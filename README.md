# markg
Markg (The g is silent) stands for: Make A Really Kool (Graph) --it's a reference to a dear friend of mine-- and aims to be a way to generate custom graphs (with theming!) through web requests, useful for iframes in READMEs.
If you're looking at the repo right now, this might be a bit weird, it's empty.. why are you looking at it? Stop it
